# Description

## Instantly drops the loot where the character dies, not where the ragdoll ends up. Ultimately, the same effect as InstantMonsterLootDrop with less overhead.

`Client only mod, but recommended that all players have it installed to make it function correctly in a server setting.`

Less overhead and more straight forward approach than InstantMonsterLootDrop mod takes.


### Questions I will probably get asked
- Are there any configurations?
  - No, not currently. I may add some in the future if I get requests for them.
- Less overhead than InstantMonsterLootDrop?
  - In case you skipped stuff above...yes, this mod is less overhead than InstantMonsterLootDrop. It doesn't use a coroutine to track state. The patches are a bit more precise.
- Is this the same implementation as you did for NoCreatureDust?
  - No, this is a different implementation. NoCreatureDust uses a different method to achieve a similar effect, but this is probably superior to even that. I will likely update NoCreatureDust to use this method in the future.
- Is this the best method?
  - Probably not, but it's the best I felt like doing and it's already better than InstantMonsterLootDrop and its clones.
