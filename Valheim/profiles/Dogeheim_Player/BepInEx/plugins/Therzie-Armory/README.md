## Upgrade your enhanced armors to the next biome, gain more powerful set effects as you gear up!

## Just like your regular Forge, the Armory requires station levels to unlock higher tier recipes, use the original forge extension pieces to level it up!

## Be sure to check the Wiki linked down below for all the recipes!

## Some armors use materials that drop from monsters from my Monstrum mod, you can change these recipes, assign the materials to monsters of your own choosing or start using Monstrum!

## Armory is currently in the proces of being reworked completely, introducing new custom made armor sets for you to craft!
