# Exploration

Adds an exploration skill that increases the exploration radius and movement speed.

Starting at skill level 20, you can record your map on the cartography table.

Starting at skill level 40, you can copy the map on the cartography table.

Starting at skill level 50, you have a chance to double the content of treasure chests.

Every level also slightly increases the radius of the wishbone.

All of this can be configured.

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.
