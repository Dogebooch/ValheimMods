>## ## Installation (manual)

>## ## Features

- Adds 7 new staves one for each biome.
- Adds 7 new wands one for each biome.
- Adds 6 armor sets, (meadows and blackforest will share one set while the remaing biomes will get their own set.)
- Adds a total of 94 magic spells (more to come..) which you can equip as an ammo for your staff/wand which means you can use multiple spells without crafting alot of staves/wands.
- Adds a new crafting station called Spell Table which you can use to craft magic spells (In order to craft magic spells you need to craft a paper from wood which you can also craft here.)
- Adds a new spell hud that displays the current equip spell (configurable: you can enable/disable it, change its colors or make it semi transparent).. only appears when you equip a staff from this mod.
- You can cycle through spells with a press of a button/hotkey (configurable)
- Configurable weapon stats, spell stats, and recipes.
- Uses ServerSync and built in config watcher.
- Configurable through config file or [Configuration Manager](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Official_BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/)
