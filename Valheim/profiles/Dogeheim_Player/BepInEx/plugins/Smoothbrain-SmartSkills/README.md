# Smart Skills

Today, I got jealous that the Iron Gate devs seem to have the smoothest brains out there. While I obviously envy their smooth brain, when it comes to the skill system in the game, it's okay for the brain to have a few wrinkles. Occasionally.

### Features

- Remembers the highest level a skill has ever reached. If you drop below that skill level, the skill will gain bonus experience, until you are back at that level.
- Weapon skills gain bonus experience, if you have any other weapon skill at a higher level. Makes switching weapon types less painful.
- Doubles swimming experience gained and removes the skill loss of the swimming skill.
- Removes the blood magic experience the shielded player gets, if the shield expires.
- The caster of a shield now gains blood magic experience, if the shielded player attacks something.
- Sneak increases backstab damage.
- Sneak gains bonus experience on backstab.

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.
