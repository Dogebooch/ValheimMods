<h2> INSTALL NOTES : </h2>

It's recommended to remove your old Therzie.WarfareFireAndIce.cfg from your config folder and let the game generate a new one on startup with new updates!

<h2> WARFARE: FIRE AND ICE VEGETATION FIX WITH UPGRADE WORLD: </h2>

If you've installed Warfare: Fire and Ice after already exploring the Deep North, vegetation will not generate accordingly.

Join my modding discord and check the channel #reset-vegetation for instructions how to reset this.
