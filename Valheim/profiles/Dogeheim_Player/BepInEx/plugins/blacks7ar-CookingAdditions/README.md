>## ## How to prepare the new added Foods (Curing)
- First you need to prepare them in the Food Preparation Table (crafting them with the new ingredients called salt)
- (Side Note: You can get/make salt by crushing salt rock in the new crafting station called Crusher. You can get Salt Rock by mining Salt Deposit that is scattered in all biomes. They're scatted on every edges or near the shore.)
- After preparing them salted meats needs to be hanged on the Drying Rack (new processing station) and it will take atleast 2 ingame days for them to be ready (NOTE: Night and weather events will stop the curing process, also Drying Racks needs to be put outside to properly work.)
- Salted eggs doesn't need to be hanged you can just put/throw them on the floor, different size eggs have different curing time smaller faster while bigger takes longer.
