# Ranching

Adds a skill that increases item yield for slaughtering tamed creatures.

Starting at skill level 10, you can see when tamed creatures become hungry again.

Starting at skill level 20, animals that are getting tame aren't afraid of you anymore and you can keep them company, to reduce the time required for them to get tame.

Starting at skill level 40, you can see pregnancy related information for tamed creatures.

All of this can be configured.

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.
