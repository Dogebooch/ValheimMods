## Changelog


#### 5.4.2332
**üîß Changed**
* Updated `libdoorstopx64.so` to be correctly named `libdoorstop_x64.so`

#### 5.4.2331
**üîß Changed**

* Updated **`libdoorstop_x64.so`** in the BepInEx package to target **glibc 2.34** by compiling against **Ubuntu 22.04**.

  * This restores compatibility with **Ubuntu 22.04**, **Debian 12**, and other Linux distributions using **glibc 2.34 or newer**.
  * Previous builds were compiled against newer glibc versions (e.g., 2.38), which caused runtime failures on older but still-supported systems.

### Compatibility Notes

* Systems using **Debian 11** or older (glibc < 2.34) are no longer supported.
* Containers like `lloesche/valheim-server-docker` must be updated to a base image that provides **glibc 2.34+**.
* If you're still encountering issues after updating, verify your runtime glibc version using:

  ```bash
  ldd --version
  ```

**üõ†Ô∏è Script Changes**
* `start_server_bepinex.sh` updated to correct vars

**Special shouts**
* Thank you to Arrowmaster for testing and help given.


#### 5.4.2330
**üîß Plugin Changes**

* **`Valheim.DisplayBepInExInfo.dll` is no longer included by default.**
  This plugin is now offered separately on Thunderstore for those who still want it [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ValheimModding/ValheimDisplayBepInExInfo/). It provided plugin counts in the main menu and in-game access to BepInEx log output via the console.

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è This change only affects *new installs* and *new profiles*. Existing setups are unaffected.
  > For debugging, it‚Äôs now recommended to either:

  * Use the console window that launches alongside the game, or
  * Directly open the `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` file.

**üìò Documentation**

* The README has been updated with more relevant, up-to-date information.
* Due to limitations on Thunderstore descriptions, any live updates or important notices for this pack will be posted on the [Wiki tab](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/wiki/).
  If you have something that should be added, contact one of the maintainers.

**‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upstream Updates**

* **Updated BepInEx from 5.4.22 to 5.4.23.3.**
* **Preloader updated** to align with this BepInEx release.
* **Doorstop upgraded to v4.4.0** as part of the upstream sync.

**üõ†Ô∏è Startup Script Improvements**

* Replaced the official BepInEx `start_game_bepinex.sh` with a **community-tested version by [Arrowmaster](https://github.com/arrowmaster)**.
  This version provides better handling of Steam launch arguments, regardless of their order.
