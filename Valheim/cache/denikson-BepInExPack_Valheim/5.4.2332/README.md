Due to Thunderstore limitations, if there is information that needs to be live updated or shared about this pack it will be listed on the [Wiki tab](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/wiki/) of the package. If you need to have something listed there, please contact one of the maintainers.

# BepInExPack for Valheim

This is [BepInEx 5.4.23.3](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.3) pack but pre-configured for Valheim. It is maintained by Azumatt, Vapok, and Margmas in the Valheim community. The specific changes and deviations from upstream BepInEx can be see in [Azumatt's Repo](https://github.com/AzumattDev/BepInEx). If changes to the pack need to be made but BepInEx itself doesn't need to update typically we will increment the version for Thunderstore. Example: `5.4.2202`, this does not mean that BepInEx itself needed to update, likely it's a small change for the game or something needed to change in the description etc.

BepInEx is a general purpose framework for Unity modding.
BepInEx includes tools and libraries to

* load custom code (hereafter *plugins*) into the game on launch;
* patch in-game methods, classes and even entire assemblies without touching original game files;
* configure plugins and log game to desired outputs like console or file;
* manage plugin dependencies.

BepInEx is currently [one of the most popular modding tools for Unity on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/modding?o=desc&s=stars).

### This pack's contents

This pack is preconfigured and usable for Valheim modding.  
In particular, the changes from base BepInEx releases are:

* Added preconfigured `BepInEx.cfg` with console enabled and correct entry point for mods.
* Added scripts necessary to run both game and dedicated server on Linux machines or through r2modman
* Edited BepInEx preloader to help with some mods patching
* Force the Valheim Game class isModded flag to true after the chainloader loads.
* Thunderstore version of the pack is printed to the console since it's separate from the actual BepInEx version if only site changes are needed.

### Installation (manual)

If you are installing this manually, do the following

1. Start with a clean install. Make triple sure your Valheim folder is *clean and unmodified*
2. Click the Manual Download button on the package page above to download the archive, it looks like this: 

    ![Manual Download Button](https://valtools.org/resources/images/manualdownloadbutton.png)
3. Once saved to your computer, extract the archive into a folder. **Do not extract into the game folder.**
4. Move the contents of `BepInExPack_Valheim` folder into `<Steam Location>\steamapps\common\Valheim`.

    ![Moving contents of BepInExPack_Valheim](https://valtools.org/resources/images/DragNDrop_ManualInstall.png)
5. Check that you have installed it correctly. 
    If done correctly, your folder will look as follows

    ![BepInEx, winhttp.dll, and doorstop_config.ini in Valheim folder.](https://valtools.org/resources/images/Highlighted.png)
5. Follow either Windows or Linux game running instructions below:

#### Configuration (Windows)

No need to configure. Simply run the game. If everything is correct, you will see a console pop up.

#### Configuration (Linux, game)

1. Make `start_game_bepinex.sh` executable with `chmod u+x start_game_bepinex.sh`.
2. In Steam, go to game's properties and set game's launch arguments to
    
	```
	./start_game_bepinex.sh %command%
	```
	
	Note to advanced users: You can change `./start_game_bepinex.sh` to full path to the script. This way you can install this pack entirely outside of game folder.
3. Run the game via Steam.

At this moment you will not see any clear indication if BepInEx works.
It is suggested to test by installing a simple plugin such as [MessageCenter from BepInEx.Utility](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.Utility).

#### Configuration (Linux, server)

This guide assumes you have enough knowledge working with Linux.  
If not, it is suggested you use a server host that supports it out of the box.

1. Make `start_server_bepinex.sh` executable with `chmod u+x start_server_bepinex.sh`.
2. Edit `start_server_bepinex.sh` to change the launch parameter like you would with Valheim's own launch script.
3. Run `start_server_bepinex.sh` to start the server.

If done correctly, you will see BepInEx bootstrap messages in the terminal.


### Checking BepInEx version and load status

If BepInEx was loaded successfully into the game, you should see a BepInEx console window launched next to the game in the taskbar (Windows):

Stacked:
![BepInEx console window in taskbar](https://valtools.org/resources/images/ConsoleWindowTaskbar.png)

Expanded:
![BepInEx console window in taskbar 2](https://valtools.org/resources/images/ConsoleWindowTaskbar2.png)

Confirm no errors or issues by having Grey/White text in the console only (Info and Message). Red are fatal errors, Dark Red are errors, Yellow are warnings, Dark Gray are debug, and any other color is a custom message.
