<h2> INSTALL NOTES : </h2>

It's recommended to remove your old Therzie.MonstrumDeepNorth.cfg from your config folder and let the game generate a new one on startup with new updates!

<h2>  ADD NEW LOCATIONS WITH UPGRADE WORLD: </h2>

New locations get loaded on new world creation, you must use Upgrade World by Jere to add the new locations provided by Monstrum Deep North to your existing world.

https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JereKuusela/Upgrade_World/

ALWAYS make a backup of your world!

If you've never used the Monstrum mods before on your old world you must have the mods installed on both your client and server as admin and use the following console command: "monstrumdeepnorth"

If you have a world with old Monstrum content, be sure to reset the Deep North biome using the command: "world_reset biomes=DeepNorth force" followed up by: "start"

For Expand World configs please join my discord community and check the pins in the #config-share channel. 

<h2> LANGUAGE OPTIONS : </h2>

Want to have my mods translated in your own language?

Checkout the Therzie translations folder in your config and translate the English.yml example translation, only change the info between the brackets " ".
Do share your translations on the #translation-share channel on my discord so that others may enjoy the game in your language!
