### Warfare aims to fill the gaps that the Valheim devs left behind and building extra on top of all that!

### Introducing new custom weapons like the War pike, Lances, Greatbows, two handed Bastard swords, throwing weapons + skill and many more!

### Warfare also adds a large variety of new crafting materials for you to grind and craft new weapons and armor with (if combined with my Armory mod).

### Warfare adds better and new combat animations to all two handed weapons making it a valid playstyle instead of the meme IronGate has designed it to be. 

### Offering new altered versions of battleaxe, sledgehammer and fenrir claws. The original recipes of these weapons are disabled on world load, you can still spawn these in. Warfare also adds a new one-handed throwable axe alternative.

### Wreak havoc on your enemies with new Crossbows and the new Greatbow weapon!

<h2> INSTALL NOTES : </h2>

It's recommended to remove your old Therzie.Warfare.cfg from your config folder and let the game generate a new one on startup with new updates!

<h2> KNOWN BUGS: </h2>

-Better Trader mod shits the bed when you add Warfare to your mods as it adds too many prefabs to the config file. Try KGMarketplace in combination with Majestic's Marketplace configs:

https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/KGvalheim/Marketplace_And_Server_NPCs_Revamped/

https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/JewelHeim/Marketplace_Configs/
