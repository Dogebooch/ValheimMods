## Trader buy & sell configuration
This mod uses the TradersExtended mod by Shudnal for it's trader system. TradersExtedended JSON files are included with this mods download package.

## More World Locations
The goal of the More World Locations series is to solve Valheims exploration problem. Valheim has a giant map but relatively few points of interest (POI) to find. Once a player learns that each biome is just a copy of what they've already seen, exploring the rest of the map feels unnecessary. The More World Locations series will fix this problem by adding dozens of handcrafted, unique, and interesting POIs to the Valheim world. I started developing the series in Febuary 2024 and have released the following mods in the series. See my mod author page for most up to date list.
