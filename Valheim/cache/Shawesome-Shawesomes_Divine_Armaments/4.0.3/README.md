üåå Relics of Divine Might ‚Äì Newly Forged for the 10th Realm üåå

üõ°Ô∏è [Armors & Capes of Celestial Origin](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/988530476492939276/1391936277963739156/image.png?ex=686db52d&is=686c63ad&hm=0ef82ce73ddf9895593eeabe1f837e50d136bcfdc7e3d19776dc8c7d86b71250&)

Clad yourself in myth. Each piece of armor and every flowing cape was hewn from rare Arcanium and infused with elemental forces‚Äîcrafted for champions destined to rival the gods themselves. Bear the chill of Fimbulvetr, the fire of Muspelheim, and the judgment of the stars.

‚öîÔ∏è [Weapons, Potions & Feasts of the Aesir](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1121975520729501696/1391182161046143026/image.png?ex=686c485a&is=686af6da&hm=55327571d90ae277c3fcf0c20af98fcd1b971a5fbcea9f7953c930c7b77f6b7b&)

Blades that burn, bows that whisper through worlds, and sledgehammers that shake the roots of Yggdrasil‚Äîevery weapon tells a saga. Empower your soul with elixirs brewed in divine stills, and feast upon meals fit for the gods, granting buffs worthy of a realm-walker.

üèõÔ∏è [Build Pieces ‚Äì Sacred Artifacts of the Old Worlds](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/988530476492939276/1391568494079901838/image.png?ex=686c5ea7&is=686b0d27&hm=dcef90ba20bf70e8992d85d07e9de737b30a75209236a2559785ccf08185d84c&)

Command the divine in stone and metal. Construct shrines, quantum relics, arcane laboratories, and Asgardian vaults. These are not mere decorations‚Äîthey are echoes of a higher realm. Place them, and reshape your stronghold into a monument of myth and power.

üé¨ A Tribute to a True Forge-Lord ‚öíÔ∏è

This EPIC showcase was generously and masterfully crafted by none other than the LEGENDARY Dhakhar ‚Äî a true artisan of Valheim‚Äôs realms.

üî• Before the forge gave birth to two mighty paths ‚Äî Divine Armaments and Infinite Multiverse ‚Äî Dhakhar captured their soul in one cinematic saga.

üõ°Ô∏è His vision, storytelling, and divine editing continue to inspire warriors and modders alike. Truly, this video stands as a Divine Relic in its own right ‚Äî forged not with hammer and anvil, but with passion, precision, and honor.

üìΩÔ∏è Let this visual saga serve as a beacon to all who seek greatness in modding and myth alike.

***‚öîÔ∏è Goal of the Mod ‚öîÔ∏è***


To make you feel like less of a mortal‚Ä¶ and more of an ascended being treading the path of God-hood.

You were chosen by the gods‚Äînot to survive Valheim, but to dominate it. As their divine spark, you have been sent Divine Armaments! God-tier relics forged in celestial fire, tempered by eons, and infused with the power of realms long forgotten.

This mod is unapologetically Asgardian‚Äîcrafted for the end-game and beyond. At its core is Arcanium, a mythical material used to forge weapons, armor, relics, and divine artifacts so powerful, even Odin might raise a brow.

From flaming swords and lightning-infused shields to godborn capes and celestial elixirs, this is a mod for those who have conquered Valheim‚Äîand now seek ascension.

Too much power? Perhaps.
Not enough? Never.
It‚Äôs not about balance‚Äîit‚Äôs about becoming the storm.

(Expect even more once the Deep North opens its gates‚Ä¶)

Whether you seek glory, chaos, or just insanely awesome loot, this is my personal saga written into code, built to let you rise above the 10th Realm‚Äîas only a true Hero of Legend could.

__About_Me__
##

[![image1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shawesome4u/Shawesomes_Divine_Armaments/main/15.png)](https://ko-fi.com/shawesome)

Hey! I‚Äôm Shawesome‚Äîa fledgling modster, proud dad, and eternal lore nerd.

I mod between diapers, date nights, and divine visions. 

I have been allocating any spare time, when not being the __BEST__ Dad and Hubby ever, to learn the process of modding valheim because cheatmode is not OP enough for me. I dare to tread the mythical realm of the Modding Gods!

If you enjoy my work and want to help fuel the forge, you can always buy me a snack on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/shawesome) to help me on my quest, Nom Nom Nom!

##

üìú Balance & Future Forgings

The stats and recipes have been tuned like the strings of a skald‚Äôs harp ‚Äî but the saga is far from finished. Tweaks and enhancements shall continue as the realms shift.

I‚Äôve included full item_IDs so fellow warriors can summon relics with ease. (Personally, I recommend the VNEI mod ‚Äî a true gift from the gods for swift browsing and spawning.)

‚öîÔ∏è Think an item‚Äôs recipe, damage, cost, or effect could be better forged? Send word! I welcome ideas with open arms ‚Äî your insight may even shape a legendary relic bearing your name... üõ†Ô∏è‚ú®

##
ü™ì For now, this is the Saga thus far... üõ°Ô∏è

The tale is still being forged in the fires of creation. More shall come, as the winds of the North whisper of greater glory yet to be revealed...
##

üì¶ What‚Äôs New in v4.0.3

Full config support for most items (still working on making the build pieces and the original 6 capes - shawesomecape, MeldursonCape, dhakharcape, fire & ice capes and valkyrie's Grace cape - configurable)

Visual updates to capes and armor

Small recipe tweaks

*Spelled Arcanium correctly lol

Added new armor set: Oblivion, to finally complete the Flaming Phoenix Feather Cape idea...

More divine chaos coming soon...
