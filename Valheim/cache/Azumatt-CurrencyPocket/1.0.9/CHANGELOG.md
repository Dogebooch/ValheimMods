| 1.0.7     | - Fix placement when certain mods are not installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 1.0.5     | - Version bump for the bog witch so people don't question if it works or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1.0.4     | - Fix issue when inventory is full where coins would not be picked up into the pocket. (Thanks Blaxxun!)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1.0.3     | - Allow valuable items to now go right into the pocket. No need to sell at trader. (Valuable means the m_value > 0 on the item). The items cause clutter in chests (especially early game where it matters) and really add nothing to the game other than forcing you to find the trader and click sell. I'm open to making it configurable, but most feedback I got was to not do so. |
| 1.0.2     | - Fix the attack of the clones. (Fix the coin dupe bugs if you didn't get the joke.) <br/> - RapidLoadouts compatibility, it can now see the coins in the pocket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1.0.1     | - Temp remove the ability to build/craft objects using the coins in the pocket. This prevents unlimited resource use and also removes the text overrides in the crafting menu. Will revisit later.<br/> - Auto add to pocket directly when moving from container to player inventory (if using moving modifiers).                                                                      |
