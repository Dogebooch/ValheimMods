# Description

## Adds a simple UI and a bit of functionality to store your coins in a "bank" on the player.

Currently, the coins in the pocket do not add weight to the player. This is partially a design choice. When extracting coins from the pocket, the coins will be added to the player's inventory (if space available).

`Client mod, not needed on server.`
---

## Mod Compatibility

Seamlessly moves the Jewelcrafting Synergy UI up and all other UI elements around to fit the new UI. Currently not very
compatible with the buttons from QuickStackStore by GoldenRevolver.
