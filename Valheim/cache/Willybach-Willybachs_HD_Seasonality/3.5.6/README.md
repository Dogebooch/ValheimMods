# 🌻 Willybach's HD Seasonality 🌻
---

## 🌳 What this mod does
---

- Offers a HD texture alternative to Rusty's Seasonality.
- Covers all fogiage, most pickables and some creatures (where I felt fur color changes made sense)
- Is designed to work with Willybach's HD Valheim
- Includes a modified version of Rusty's Seasonality config file that activates the folder 'WillybachHD' - and therefore this mod

## 🌲 Mod Dependencies
---

- BepInEx is required
- Rusty's Seasonality is required (my mod does not actually overwrite any of his files but may need to be activated - see below.

## 🍂 Installation
---

- Install BepinEx and Rusty's Seasonality
- Recommended! Run the game with Rusty's Seasonality installed - to check it's working but also so that it generates its config file. 
- Install Willybach's HD Seasonality
- The modified config file which alters the target folder from 'default' to 'WillybachHD' should now overwrite Seasonality's. 

## 💧 Issues
--- 

- If you run Seasonality AFTER installed the HD version, it will generate its config file as it always does the FIRST time it runs.
- If this occurs you can obviously, redownload or re-add my own config file.
- Or you can find this file in BepInEx/Config folder: RustyMods.Seasonality.cfg

Change the following lines:

[1 - Settings]
Texture Folder = Default (Change this to 'WillybachHD' without the brackets)
[Fall]
Random Colors = On (change this to Off) - this will remove default Seasonality's Red overlay in Fall to some foliage.
