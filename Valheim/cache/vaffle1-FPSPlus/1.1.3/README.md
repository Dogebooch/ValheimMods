# FPSPlus

This mod for Valheim optimizes game performance by significantly increasing the frame rate (FPS) without compromising visual quality.  The mod is especially effective in scenes with intense lighting or a lot of visual effects such as smoke and fire.

**The basic idea:** Make Valheim smoother and more responsive without sacrificing a beautiful picture.

## Functionality

* **Rendering optimization:** The mod introduces various rendering optimizations aimed at improving game performance.
*   **FPS Boost:** The expected FPS gain is up to **50%** depending on your system and scene.
* **Quality preservation:** The mod strives to maintain the visual quality of the game by making minimal changes to the graphics.  You won't notice any significant changes in the details or effects.
* **Improvement in difficult scenes:** The most noticeable performance improvement is observed in scenes with:
* Multiple light sources (for example, in settlements with a large number of torches).
    *   Visual effects such as smoke, fire, and fog.
    * A large number of objects in the frame.

## Why is this necessary?

* **Smoother game play:** Improved FPS makes the game smoother and more responsive, which increases the comfort of the gameplay.
* **Elimination of jerks:** The mod helps to reduce or eliminate jerks that may occur in scenes with a high load on the graphics card.
* **Improvement in the multiplayer game:** Higher FPS is especially useful in multiplayer games where performance can suffer due to the large number of players and objects.
* **The ability to play on weaker systems:** The mod allows you to increase FPS on systems with lower specifications, which makes the game more accessible to more players.
