# Config Watcher

Reloads cfg files, if they are changed, so you don't have to restart the game / server.

## Installation

This isn't a plugin, but a patcher. If you are installing this manually, make sure to move the DLL into the patchers folder, instead of the plugins folder.

## Warning

There are some mods out there that don't use the BepInEx config values for configs, but for something else. Changing them, while the game is running, might break these mods.
