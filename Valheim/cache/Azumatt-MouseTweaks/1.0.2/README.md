## Features

- **Hover to Move/Drop**: Hold left control and left-click to move/drop items by hovering over them, eliminating the
  need to click each item individually.
- **Right-Click Functionality**: Place one item from a stack or drop one item on the ground with a simple right-click. (
  Hold the stack first)
- **Shift and Right-Click**: Pick up half of a stack without entering the split screen.
- **Double Left-Click**: Quickly grab a full stack of an item, merging multiple items in your inventory seamlessly.
