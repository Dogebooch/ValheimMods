# Zen.ModLib

This is a core dependency, shared library for all `ZenMods`

It encapsulates common reusable functions and behaviors that are shared across all `ZenMods`

It should be included automatically by any `ZenMod` you install if you are using a package manager like R2 or Gale. If you are not using a package manager, you need to install this manually.

Generally this would be run with other `ZenMods`. However, even by itself, it applies the following: 
- Validates all the items and recipes added to the ObjectDB from any mods to make sure they are formed correctly. 
- Puts your avatar into a floating animation when you are in debug fly mode.  So that's nice.
- Fixes a few small vanilla bugs.

But you should really use this in conjunction with another `ZenMod`, because that's its intended purpose.
