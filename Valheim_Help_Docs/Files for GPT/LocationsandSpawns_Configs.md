- [custom_raids.cfg](#custom-raids-cfg)

### custom_raids.cfg

```

# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
RemoveAllExistingRaids = false

## Enable/disable override of existing events when event names match.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
OverrideExisting = true

## Minutes between checks for starting raids.
## When the interval has passed, all raids are checked for valid conditions and a random valid one is selected. Chance is then rolled for if it should start.
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 46
EventCheckInterval = 60

## Chance of raid, per check interval. 100 is 100%.
## Note: Not used if UseIndividualRaidChecks is enabled, each raid will have their own chance in that case.
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 20
EventTriggerChance = 40

[General]

## Loads raid configurations from supplemental files.
## Eg. custom_raid.supplemental.my_raid.cfg will be included on load.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
LoadSupplementalRaids = true

## Generates pre-defined supplemental raids. The generated raids are disabled by default.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
GeneratePresetRaids = true

## Disables automatic updating and saving of raid configurations on loadup.
## This mainly means no comments or missing options will be added, but.. allows you to keep things compact.
## Note: This also has a massive impact upon load time.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
StopTouchingMyConfigs = true

## Server option. If enabled, pauses the event timers when no players are online. 
## This means if a raid happened a minute before everyone logged out, and everyone logs in an hour later, the game will consider the last raid as having happened one minute before the login.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
PauseEventTimersWhileOffline = true

[IndividualRaids]

## If enabled, Custom Raids will overhaul the games way of checking for raids.
## EventTriggerChance will no longer be used, as the chance will be set per raid.
## This allows for setting individual frequences and chances for each raid.
## This overhaul gives each raid it's own timer, independent of each other and can therefore cause a LOT of raids.
## EventCheckInterval will still be used to indicate time between checks. 
## MinTimeBetweenRaids can be used to ensure they don't happen too often.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
UseIndividualRaidChecks = false

## If overhaul is enabled, ensures a minimum amount of minutes between each raid.
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 46
MinimumTimeBetweenRaids = 120

### spawn_that.world_spawners_advanced.cfg

```
# Auto-generated file for adding World Spawner configurations.
# This file is empty by default. It is intended to contains changes only, to avoid unintentional modifications as well as to reduce unnecessary performance cost.
# Full documentation can be found at https://asharppen.github.io/Valheim.SpawnThat.
# To get started:
#     1. Generate default configs in BepInEx/Debug folder, by enabling WriteSpawnTablesToFileBeforeChanges in 'spawn_that.cfg'.
#     2. Start game and enter a world, and wait a short moment (ca. 10 seconds) for files to generate.
#     3. Go to generated file, and copy the creatures you want to modify into this file
#     4. Make your changes.
# To find modded configs and change those, enable WriteSpawnTablesToFileAfterChanges in 'spawn_that.cfg', and do as described above.

## Loads drop table configurations from supplemental files.
## Eg. drop_that.character_drop.my_drops.cfg will be included on load.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true

[Performance]

## When enabled, will always attempt to create stacks of items when dropping, instead of creating items one by one.
## Eg. 35 coin stack, instead of 35 individual 1 coin drops.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
AlwaysAutoStack = true

## When greater than 0, will limit the maximum number of items dropped at a time. This is intended for guarding against multipliers.
## Eg. if limit is 100, and attempting to drop 200 coins, only 100 will be dropped.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: -1
DropLimit = -1

### drop_that.character_drop.cfg

```
# Auto-generated file for adding CharacterDrop configurations.
# This file is empty by default. It is intended to contains changes only, to avoid unintentional modifications as well as to reduce unnecessary performance cost.
# Full documentation can be found at https://github.com/ASharpPen/Valheim.DropThat/wiki.
# To get started: 
#     1. Generate default configs in BepInEx/Debug folder, by enabling WriteCharacterDropsToFile in 'drop_that.cfg'.
#     2. Start game and enter a world, and wait a short moment for files to generate.
#     3. Go to generated file, and copy the drops you want to modify from there into this file
#     4. Make your changes.
# To find modded configs and change those, enable WriteLoadedConfigsToFile in 'drop_that.cfg', and do as described above.

#### 2. Raid System Optimization
- **Custom Raids**: Configurable raid events with individual timing and chance controls
- **Event Check Interval**: Currently set to 60 minutes between raid checks
- **Event Trigger Chance**: 40% chance per check interval
- **Individual Raid Checks**: Can be enabled for per-raid timing control

1. **Increase Combat Density**: Higher spawn rates and raid frequency
2. **Reduce Exploration Rewards**: Lower material drops from non-combat sources
3. **Enhance Combat Rewards**: Better loot from combat encounters
4. **Thematic Consistency**: Maintain Ashlands' dangerous atmosphere

### Performance Optimization Notes
- **Spawn Quantity Reductions**: 40-60% reduction with enhanced elite density compensation
