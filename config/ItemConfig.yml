# Things you can change: amount, weight, weight factor, stack, stack factor, pickup, floating, teleportable, loss.
# Things you can configure per world level: amount, pickup, teleportable, loss.

# Note: If you are using mods that create custom items / prefabs, you might need to add and configure them
#       explicitly by creating your own groups for those. Predefined groups only contain Valheim's original
#       items. 

# Define your own groups here and assign items via display name (or the internal ID) to your groups.
# Hint: If you want to find the internal ID of an item, you can look it up in the wiki.

# For custom items, please refer to the documentation of the mod that adds them.
