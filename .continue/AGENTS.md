## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### **Core Systems**
- **JewelHeim-RelicHeim Modpack** - Primary content foundation
- **EpicLoot** - RNG magical item generation (Magic/Rare/Legendary/Mythic)
- **Drop That** - Loot table control & world level gating
- **CLLC** - World level & star scaling, elite affixes
- **WackyDB** - Item/recipe database management

- **Warpalicious**: World generation & locations
- **Smoothbrain**: QoL & gameplay enhancements
- **Magic Revamp & Wizardry**: Expanded spell systems

## üéÆ Game Design Philosophy

### **Progression Flow**
1. **Early (WL 0-2)**: Basic items + EpicLoot Magic/Rare drops
2. **Mid (WL 3-5)**: RelicHeim set items (crafted) + EpicLoot Legendary
3. **Late (WL 6+)**: EpicLoot Mythic + T5 Legendaries (boss-only)

### **World Level Gating**
- **WL 0-1** ‚Üí Meadows | **WL 2-3** ‚Üí Black Forest | **WL 3-4** ‚Üí Swamp
- **WL 4-5** ‚Üí Mountains | **WL 5-6** ‚Üí Plains | **WL 6-7** ‚Üí Mistlands
- **WL 7+** ‚Üí Deep North/Ashlands
- **Age-Based WL progression**: WL1=15d, WL2=45d, WL3=90d, WL4=180d, WL5=300d, WL6=420d, WL7=540d

### **Loot Systems Integration**

| System | RNG? | Source | Purpose | Affixes |
|--------|------|--------|---------|---------|
| **EpicLoot Magic** | ‚úÖ | Random drops | RNG progression | 1 affix |
| **EpicLoot Rare** | ‚úÖ | Random drops | RNG progression | 2 affixes |
| **EpicLoot Legendary** | ‚úÖ | Random drops | High-tier RNG | 3+ affixes |
| **EpicLoot Mythic** | ‚úÖ | Random drops | Top-tier RNG | Special effects |
| **RelicHeim Sets** | ‚ùå | Crafted | Set bonuses | Static stats |
| **T5 Legendaries** | ‚ùå | Boss kills | Best-in-slot | Static, boss-only |

## üìÅ Critical File Structure

### **Configuration Directories**

```

### **Project Management**
- `important_files_updated.txt` - Enhanced file index with metadata
- `List_Important_files.py` - Unified index generator
- `.gitignore` - Selective file inclusion (configs/docs only)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Standards

### **Drop That Rules**
- All chase loot: `drop_one_per_player = true`
- Star gating: `creature_stars_required = 2` (Magic/Rare), `= 3` (T4)
- Scaling: `scale_by_level = true`
- **CRITICAL**: `world_level_min` must match EpicLoot configs

### **EpicLoot Rules**
- Effect types: `"Magic" | "Rare" | "Legendary" | "None"`
- Use `GuaranteedMagicEffects` for affix pools
- Legendary items: fixed UniqueIDs, predefined stats
- **CRITICAL**: `world_level_min` must equal Drop That's

### **Spawn That Rules**
- Global `SpawnFrequencyMultiplier` tuned to `0.95` across world and raid spawners for a slight overall spawn reduction

### **Data Formatting**
- **Tab-delimited** for spreadsheets
- **Grouped order**: Master List ‚Üí DropThat Config ‚Üí EpicLoot Config
- **Consistent naming** across all configs
- **Proactive validation** for biome gating errors

## üéØ AI Work Preferences

### **Balance Philosophy**
- **No early BiS drops** - maintain proper gating
- **Consistent progression** across biomes
- **Moderate creativity** for stats/names, **strict** on formatting
- **Proactive validation** for misclassification

### **Automation Goals**
- **Minimize repetitive edits**
- **AI-assisted config generation**
- **Keep Drop That/EpicLoot/CLLC consistent**
- **Avoid duplicate loot entries**

### **Output Standards**
- **Tab-delimited** for spreadsheets
- **Grouped configurations** in consistent order
- **Master loot list** as single source of truth
- **Cross-reference validation** between mods

## üìö Problems Solved & Fixes Applied

### **File Organization & Indexing**
- **Problem**: Large number of files (2,979+) needed proper organization
- **Solution**: Created unified index generator with TYPE/IMPORTANCE_TAGS classification
- **Result**: Comprehensive file index with enhanced metadata

### **Git Repository Management**
- **Problem**: "Too many active changes" and large binary files
- **Solution**: Refined `.gitignore` for selective inclusion, reset repository
- **Result**: Clean repository with only important configs/docs

### **Legendary Systems Confusion**
- **Problem**: Unclear differences between EpicLoot, RelicHeim sets, T5 legendaries
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive clarification table and progression flow
- **Result**: Clear understanding of 4 distinct legendary systems

### **Missing Prefab Warnings**
- **Problem**: Drop That and Spawn That reported missing prefabs (`ShieldBronze`, `CoinTroll`)
- **Solution**: Renamed drop entry to `ShieldBronzeBuckler` and patched CoinTrollSpawn to register the custom troll during `ZNetScene.Awake`
- **Result**: Prefabs now load correctly, eliminating configuration warnings

### **Tempest Serpent Boss Setup**
- **Problem**: Tempest Serpent lacked distinct visuals and boss-worthy loot.
- **Solution**: Capped level at 5-star limit, enlarged model with lightning infusion and armored effect, and expanded drop table with trophy, meat, coins, thunderstones, and legendary weapon rolls.
- **Result**: Deep-ocean boss encounter now stands out and offers exciting rewards.

### **EpicMMO Dexterity Soft Cap**
- **Problem**: Added Dexterity stamina soft cap entries were not recognized by EpicMMO System
- **Solution**: Removed unsupported soft cap settings, keeping base stamina bonuses only
- **Result**: Prevents non-functional config lines and maintains balanced stamina progression

### **Biome-Specific Treasure Loot**
- **Problem**: Generic MagicMaterials set used across all chests limited biome-based progression
- **Solution**: Replaced chest loot with biome-specific sets and boosted legendary/mythic weights for late biomes
- **Result**: Higher-tier chests now provide proportionally better materials

### **Bounty Board Group Integration**
- **Problem**: Group bounties required manual participant tracking and only split coin rewards
- **Solution**: BountyBoard now uses the Groups API to auto-detect party members and divide coin and token rewards
- **Result**: Cooperative bounties automatically share payouts among current group members

### **Treasure Chest Loot Rolls**
- **Problem**: Some treasure chests could roll zero items.
- **Solution**: Updated drop tables to remove zero-roll chance, ensuring a minimum of one item.
- **Result**: Treasure chests now always yield at least one piece of loot.

### **Mod Creature Drop World Levels**
- **Problem**: Newly added modded creature loot tables were not yet reviewed for biome/world-level balance.
- **Solution**: Audited each mod creature drop list to ensure materials match the creature's intended biome (e.g., Fox_TW drops early-game LeatherScraps while CorruptedDvergerMage_TW yields Mistlands BlackCore/Softtissue).
- **Result**: Mod creature loot tables align with world-level progression.

### **VNEI Load Performance**
- **Problem**: VNEI UI loaded slowly with unknown items and recipes visible
- **Solution**: Enabled "Show Only Known" (server-forced) in com.maxsch.valheim.vnei.cfg
- **Result**: Faster VNEI load times
- 
### **Loot Generation Validation**
- **Problem**: Duplicate `(PrefabID, ItemPrefab)` pairs could stack drop probabilities in generated configs
- **Solution**: Added validation in `generate_loot_configs.py` to detect duplicates and abort generation
- **Result**: Prevents accidental probability stacking during loot config creation

### **AxeSilver Prefab Error**
- **Problem**: More World Locations loot lists referenced `AxeSilver` causing prefab errors.
- **Solution**: Replaced with `AxeSilver_TW` to match modded prefab.
- **Result**: AxeSilver loot lists load without errors.

## üö® Current Pain Points

### **Technical Challenges**
- Keeping loot scaling consistent across 100s of entries
- Preventing early-tier loot from persisting into late-game
- Managing multiple mod item lists without missing prefabs

### **Current Priorities**
- Integrate bounty board plugin enabling random rewards, group hunts, and skill-gated bounties
- Gate SeekerQueen world spawns behind BlackCore harvest flag with WL-scaled drops (silk, trophies, enchant mats, XP orbs)
- Refine endgame loot pool using existing assets
- Balance magic vs static loot drop rates
- Ensure boss-locked BiS items feel worth the grind
- Streamline AI ‚Üí config ‚Üí game pipeline
- Monitor increased Mushroom Monster spawn rates across biomes for balance
- Balanced Mushroom boss drops: WL-scaled coins guaranteed, portal key guaranteed, and rare (~5%/1% overall via 2.5%/0.5% per-roll) gold/silver statues per player
- Maintain progression-based loot tables for Mushroom Monsters (bosses excluded; rare mushrooms drop-one-per-player)
- Evaluate new Tempest Serpent deep-ocean boss spawn and loot balance
- Tempest Serpent loot now world-level gated with rare XP orb drop; monitor balance and drop rates
- Add coin-gated Troll encounter in Black Forest requiring 500+ coins and heavy carry weight; uses separate CoinTroll prefab with boss visuals and WL-based loot: trophy/coins/finewood (WL2), runestone (WL3), iron scrap (WL4), and Yggdrasil wood (WL6+)
- Track balance for new Leech Matron swamp spawns (rainy nights, deep water) and expanded loot (ooze, blood pearls, bloodbags, entrails, amber pearls, EpicLoot magic weapon) with lightning infusion visuals

## üí° Loot System Ideas / TODO
- Introduce boss-specific unique drops with rare rates and signature effects.
- Expand RelicHeim armor sets with scalable set bonuses tied to world levels.
- Implement tiered loot tables that unlock stronger rewards at higher world levels.
- Add a boss currency or token system for deterministic reward exchanges.
- Highlight rare drops and track boss killcounts for social/cosmetic rewards.
- Provide independent loot rolls for group boss fights to incentivize co-op play.
- Run rotating boss events with temporary loot modifiers or event-exclusive items.
- Drop relic fragments that players combine into upgraded or legendary versions.
- Added Ashlands Stone Golem spawning near lava in clear weather with high fire resistance, CLLC scaling, and world-level gated loot (Flametal/Obsidian/MagmaCore) plus rare XP orbs.

## Roaming Bosses
- **Tempest Neck** ‚Äì Spawns along coastlines during thunderstorms; drops storm glands for early lightning gear.
- **Toll Troll** ‚Äì Haunts bridge crossings at night; drops coin sacks and toll tokens for trader unlocks.
- **Leech Matron** ‚Äì Emerges from deep swamp waters after dusk; yields blood sacs for mid-tier alchemy.
- **Avalanche Drake** ‚Äì Circles mountain peaks during blizzards; drops frost cores for cold-resist crafting.
- **Royal Lox** ‚Äì Roams plains herds in daylight; drops regal hides for high-tier saddles.
- **Tempest Serpent** ‚Äì Surfaces in ocean squalls; provides abyssal fangs for sea-raid gear.
- **Weaver Queen** ‚Äì Lurks in mistlands nests; drops silk bundles for advanced weaving.
- **Magma Golem** ‚Äì Rises in ashlands lava flows; drops magma cores for fire weapons.
- **Frost Wyrm** ‚Äì Patrols deep north blizzards; drops frozen hearts for frost enchantments.

## Roaming Bosses
- **Tempest Neck**: Giant Neck that roams Meadows only during thunderstorms. Uses scaled Neck prefab (x3), lightning infusion, spawns away from player structures, and drops world-level gated coins, enchant scrolls, and thunderstones with low drop rates (F/B/A scrolls at 50%/35%/20%, thunderstones at 25%).
