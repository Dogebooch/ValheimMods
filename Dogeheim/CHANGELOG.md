## Version 1.5.11 - Global Bow Balance, Quiver Tuning & Enchanting Integration *(Testing)*

*Reduced stacked projectile speed effects and standardized bow handling across mods; converted quivers to utility pieces with minimal armor; enabled VES scroll enchanting for MagicBows, Bow of Frey, and Wizardry items.*

#### Bow Velocity/Draw-Time Normalization
- **Global stacking reduction**:
  - BowPlugin: `Velocity Multiplier = 2` (was 3) in both main and Dogeheim configs
  - Files updated: `config/blacks7ar.BowPlugin.cfg`, `Dogeheim/Configs/blacks7ar.BowPlugin.cfg`
- **BowsBeforeHoes (bows)**:
  - Black Forest, Seeker, Surtling bows set to `Velocity = 55`, `Maximum Draw Time = 2.6`
  - Files updated: `config/Azumatt.BowsBeforeHoes.cfg`, `Dogeheim/Configs/Azumatt.BowsBeforeHoes.cfg`
- **MagicBows (bows)**:
  - Fiery, Frozen, Lightning, Spirit, Toxic bows set to `Velocity = 55`, `Maximum Draw Time = 2.4`
  - File updated: `config/blacks7ar.MagicBows.cfg`
- **Crossbows**: unchanged (retain distinct feel via higher projectile speed/instant draw)

#### Quiver Armor Tuning
- All quivers (Black Forest, Lox, OdinPlus, Seeker): `Armor = 1`, `Armor per Level = 0`
- Files updated: `config/Azumatt.BowsBeforeHoes.cfg`, `Dogeheim/Configs/Azumatt.BowsBeforeHoes.cfg`

#### Impact
- **Consistent trajectories**: Less variance between mods; reduced early overperformance from stacked velocity
- **Progression preserved**: Power now tracks bow tier, upgrades, bow skill, and arrow choice more than raw projectile speed
- **Quivers**: Serve as utility without adding significant armor

## Version 1.4.7 - Trader Menu Overlap Fix *(Testing)*

*Fixed overlapping trader menus caused by TradersExtended GUI positioning conflicts.*

#### Trader Interface Fix
- **Fixed overlapping trader menus**: Resolved visual conflict where two trader interfaces would overlap
  - **Root cause**: TradersExtended mod was using fixed GUI positioning `{"x":200.0,"y":150.0}` that conflicted with base game trader interface
  - **Solution**: Reset GUI position to default `{"x":0.0,"y":0.0}` to allow natural positioning
  - **Files updated**: 
    - `config/shudnal.TradersExtended.cfg`

  - **Divine capes** (Fire God Surtur Cape, Frost God Jotnar Cape): **0.8-1.0% â†’ 0.2%** (5x rarer)
- **Added level-gated safety restrictions** to prevent early-game acquisition:
  - **Fader drops**: Require minimum level 3 creatures + player kills only
  - **Deep North/Ashlands drops**: Require minimum level 4 creatures + player kills only
- **Root cause addressed**: Previous 1-4% drop rates were causing game-breaking early acquisition
- **Impact**: Divine armaments now properly rare (1 in 300-500 kills) and limited to appropriate end-game content
- **Files updated**:
  - `config/_RelicHeimFiles/Drop,Spawn_That/zz_Doug/drop_that.character_drop.additional_missing_items.Doug.cfg`
  - `config/_RelicHeimFiles/Drop,Spawn_That/zz_Doug/drop_that.character_drop.missing_items.Doug.cfg`
  - `Dogeheim/Configs/_RelicHeimFiles/Drop,Spawn_That/zz_Doug/drop_that.character_drop.additional_missing_items.Doug.cfg`

## Version 1.4.6 - Staff of the Artificer Drop Rebalancing *(Testing)*

*Moved Staff of the Artificer from early-game Abomination to late-game Fader enemies for better loot progression and game balance.*

#### Staff of the Artificer Drop Changes
- **Removed from Abomination**: Disabled Staff of the Artificer drops from Swamp biome Abominations
  - **Previous**: 4% drop chance from early-game enemies
  - **Issue**: Players getting end-game weapons too early in progression
- **Added to Fader**: Staff of the Artificer now drops from Ashlands Fader enemies
  - **New drop chance**: 1% (reduced from 4% for rarity)
  - **Better progression**: Players encounter Faders when they have access to required materials
  - **Appropriate difficulty**: Fader enemies match the item's power level and crafting requirements

#### Loot Progression Improvements
- **Material access**: Players will have Arcanium, HasRefiner_Item, and FlametalNew when they reach Ashlands
- **Skill requirements**: Blacksmithing level 80 requirement aligns with late-game progression
- **Thematic fit**: High-tier magical weapon from Shawesomes_Divine_Armaments mod suits end-game enemies
- **Rarity balance**: 1% drop chance makes it a valuable and rare find

#### Configuration Files Updated
- `config/_RelicHeimFiles/Drop,Spawn_That/zz_Doug/drop_that.character_drop.additional_missing_items.Doug.cfg`
- `Dogeheim/Configs/_RelicHeimFiles/Drop,Spawn_That/zz_Doug/drop_that.character_drop.additional_missing_items.Doug.cfg`

## Version 1.4.5 - Greydwarf Spawn Rate Rebalancing *(Testing)*

*Reverted greydwarf nest spawn rates to base RelicHeim values for improved game balance and stability.*

#### Greydwarf Nest Spawner Adjustments
- **Restored greydwarf nest spawn rates to base RelicHeim configuration**:
  - `config/_RelicHeimFiles/Drop,Spawn_That/spawn_that.spawnarea_spawners.PilesNests.cfg`:
    - **SpawnInterval**: 25 â†’ 15 seconds (faster spawning, base RelicHeim value)
    - **ConditionMaxCloseCreatures**: 4 â†’ 2 (standard creature limits)
    - **SpawnWeight**: 8 â†’ 5 (standard spawn chance for regular greydwarfs)
- **Applied to both main config and Dogeheim directory** for consistency
- **Impact**: More frequent but balanced greydwarf spawning at nests, matching original RelicHeim experience

#### Spawn Configuration Rationale
- **Faster spawn intervals**: 15-second intervals provide more consistent combat encounters
- **Standard creature limits**: Maximum 2 greydwarfs near nests prevents overwhelming players
- **Balanced spawn weights**: Regular greydwarfs (5) spawn more often than elites (1) and shamans (1)
- **Maintains challenge**: Keeps Black Forest engaging without being overwhelming

---

## Version 1.4.4 - Black Forest Stability & Debugging Improvements *(Testing)*

*Fixed critical Black Forest freezing issues and enhanced debugging capabilities for better troubleshooting.*

#### Black Forest Raid Stability Fixes
- **Disabled problematic Doug's Lore Raids** that were causing Black Forest freezing:

    - **Elder_Rite_P1_JH**: Disabled (was causing chained raid conflicts)
    - **Elder_Rite_P2_JH**: Disabled (chained raid with environment conflicts)
- **Root cause identified**: Chained raids with forced environment changes (`DeepForest Mist` â†’ `ThunderStorm`) and high spawn rates (95% per interval) were overwhelming the game's systems
- **Impact**: Should resolve freezing and crashing issues specifically in Black Forest biome

#### Enhanced BepInEx Logging Configuration
- **Enabled comprehensive logging** for better debugging and error tracking:
  - `config/BepInEx.cfg`:
    - **Console Log Levels**: Added `Info` level for detailed console output

  - **Removed chained raid system**: Eliminated `OnStopStartRaid` to prevent cascading effects
  - **Reduced spawn rates**: All raids reduced from 95% to 65% spawn chance per interval for better balance
  - **Removed forced environments**: Eliminated `ForceEnvironment` settings to prevent conflicts with other mods
  - **Made all raids independent**: Each raid now operates independently without chaining
- **Specific improvements made**:
  - **Bog Uprising raids**: Removed chaining and forced environments, reduced spawn rates
  - **Hunt of Moder raids**: Removed chaining and forced environments, reduced spawn rates  
  - **Warband of Yagluth raids**: Removed chaining and forced environments, reduced spawn rates
  - **Black Forest raids**: Remain disabled due to previous stability issues

#### EpicMMO System Balancing & Quality of Life Improvements
- **Attribute Maximums**: Reduced from 100 to 75 points for all attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Endurance, Vigour, Specializing)
- **Enhanced Bonus Points**: Extended bonus point system to level 120 with improved progression:
  - Levels 5-90: Enhanced bonus points (e.g., level 15: +3, level 20: +4, level 60: +5)
  - Levels 95-120: New bonus points (level 95: +4, level 100: +5, level 120: +7)
- **Improved Drop System**: Enabled drops from non-player kills (`RemoveAllDrops From NonPlayer Kills = false`)
- **Mob Level Display**: Removed mob level UI string for cleaner interface
