# Taming Guide

## Overview
Taming animals in Valheim provides companionship, resources, and combat assistance. This guide covers both vanilla mechanics and modded enhancements.

## Tameable Creatures
- **Boars**: Meadows/Black Forest - Raspberries, mushrooms, carrots, blueberries
- **Wolves**: Mountains - Raw meat (deer/boar)
- **Lox**: Plains - Barley, cloudberries
- **Chickens/Hens**: Hatch from eggs
- **Darkhorn**: Raspberries, ~30 minutes
- **Asksvins**: Mod-specific creatures

## Boar Taming Guide

### Preferred Foods
Boars can be tamed with the following food items:
- **Raspberries**
- **Blueberries** 
- **Carrots**
- **Onions**
- **Turnips**
- **Red Mushrooms**

### Taming Process
1. **Build a secure pen** using stakewalls or roundpole fences with a gate
2. **Approach wild boar cautiously** to avoid alarming it (avoid the red exclamation mark)
3. **Lure the boar into the pen** and secure the enclosure
4. **Drop preferred food items** on the ground within the pen
5. **Maintain distance** (stay within 64m but avoid alerting the boar)
6. **Monitor the taming progress** - the process typically takes about 30 minutes of uninterrupted gameplay
7. **Ensure continuous food availability** throughout the taming period

### Important Notes
- **Avoid fire sources**: Boars are frightened by fire, including torches, which can disrupt the taming process
- **Keep the environment calm**: Ensure the pen is free from any fire sources to maintain a peaceful atmosphere
- **Patience is key**: The taming process requires time and consistent food availability

### Breeding Tamed Boars
Once tamed, boars can be bred by:
- Keeping them **happy and well-fed** with the same food items used for taming
- Ensuring **two tamed boars are in close proximity**
- Providing **adequate food** for both boars
- Watching for **pink hearts** which indicate they are ready to breed
- After a short period, a **piglet will be born** and mature into an adult boar over time

## Aggressive Effects and Breeding

### Understanding Aggressive Effects
- **Biome Boss Triggers**: After defeating biome bosses, creatures (including Darkhorn) can gain **Aggressive** effects (30-50% chance)
- **Effect Duration**: These effects can persist and impact creature behavior
- **Visual Indicators**: Aggressive creatures may display different behaviors or visual cues

### Impact on Breeding
**Aggression can significantly affect mating success:**
- **Reduced Mating**: Aggressive behaviors can hinder breeding attempts
- **Increased Conflict**: Aggressive creatures may attack potential mates instead of breeding
- **Lower Success Rates**: Research shows aggression negatively correlates with reproductive success

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Separate Aggressive Creatures**: Keep aggressive individuals away from breeding pairs
2. **Acclimation Period**: Allow potential mates to get used to each other's presence
3. **Environmental Calm**: Ensure breeding areas are peaceful and free from disturbances
4. **Monitor Behavior**: Watch for signs of aggression and separate if needed
5. **Patience**: Aggressive effects may diminish over time

### Darkhorn-Specific Notes
- **Taming Food**: Raspberries (takes ~30 minutes)
- **Aggressive Susceptibility**: Can be affected by biome-based aggressive effects
- **Breeding Challenges**: May require extra care if aggressive effects are present

## Taming Process
1. **Build secure pen** with stakewalls/roundpole fences and gate
2. **Lure creature** inside and secure enclosure
3. **Place preferred food** in pen
4. **Maintain distance** (64m) - avoid alerting
5. **Monitor progress** - yellow hearts indicate feeding, wait for 100% completion

## Requirements
- Creature not hungry or alerted
- No fire sources nearby
- Stay within 64m range
- Monitor acclimatizing state

## Breeding
- Two tamed creatures of same species
- Both well-fed and in proximity
- Provide adequate space for offspring
- Watch for heart symbols

## Mod Enhancements
- **AllTameable**: Expanded taming options
- **CLLC**: Affects creature stats/behavior
- **EpicMMO**: 5x XP for taming
- **DNA System**: Random traits and colors
- **Crossbreeding**: Hybrid offspring possible
- **Egg Hatching**: Dragon eggs with inherited traits

## Automated Feeding (PetPantry)
- **Automated feeding** from nearby containers
- **Event-driven**: Only feeds when animals are hungry
- **Efficient management**: Dynamic container registration
- **Cooldown system**: Prevents excessive feed checks

### PetPantry Setup
1. **Build pen**: Secure enclosure with adequate space
2. **Place container**: Chest within PetPantry range
3. **Stock food**: Fill with creature's preferred food
4. **Configure**: Adjust ContainerRange and FeedCheckCooldown
5. **Monitor**: System automatically feeds when needed

## Care & Maintenance
- Regular feeding with preferred foods
- Secure protection from predators
- Accommodate creature sizes
- Use for resources, defense, companionship
