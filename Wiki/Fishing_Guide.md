## Overview

Fishing in Valheim is a valuable skill that provides high-quality food resources and can be a profitable activity. The fishing system requires specific equipment, bait types, and knowledge of optimal locations to maximize your catch rates and experience gains.

## Fishing Mechanics

### Required Equipment
- **Fishing Rod**: Purchased from Haldor the Trader for 350 coins
- **Bait**: Available from Haldor (sold in bulk) or crafted by combining trophies with basic bait

### How to Fish

1. **Equip the Fishing Rod and Bait**: Ensure both are in your inventory and equipped
2. **Casting the Line**: Hold the left mouse button to charge your cast; release to cast the line
   - Longer charge = farther cast distance
3. **Waiting for a Bite**: Watch the bobber; when it dips underwater, a fish has bitten
4. **Hooking the Fish**: Quickly press the right mouse button to hook the fish
5. **Reeling In**: Hold the right mouse button to reel in the fish
   - **Stamina Management**: Reeling consumes stamina, especially if the fish struggles. You can either keep an eye on the fish, when it starts to move a lot, or keep an eye on your stamina gauge when it starts to go down quickly.
   - **Distance Limit**: Moving more than ~30 meters from the bobber breaks the line
6. **Collecting the Fish**: Once the fish is close, press the 'use' button to pick it up

### Experience System
- **Reeling Empty Line**: Provides Fishing skill XP (even without a catch)
- **Reeling in Fish**: Grants roughly double Fishing skill XP compared to reeling an empty line
- **Important**: Picking up a fish without fully reeling does not grant Fishing skill XP. With EpicMMO enabled, that pickup can still grant EpicMMO XP, but it won't level Fishing.

## Bait Progression & Crafting

Different fish species require specific bait types, which can be crafted by combining standard Fishing Bait with various trophies.

### Bait Types and Crafting Recipes

| Bait Type | Recipe | Target Fish |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Normal Bait** | Purchased from Haldor | Perch, Pike |
| **Mossy Bait** | 20 Fishing Bait + 1 Troll Trophy | Trollfish |
| **Sticky Bait** | 20 Fishing Bait + 1 Abomination Trophy | Giant Herring |
| **Cold Bait** | 20 Fishing Bait + 1 Fenring Trophy | Tetra |
| **Stingy Bait** | 20 Fishing Bait + 1 Fuling Trophy | Grouper |
| **Misty Bait** | 20 Fishing Bait + 1 Lox Trophy | Pufferfish, Anglerfish |
| **Hot Bait** | 20 Fishing Bait + 1 Surtling Trophy | Magmafish |
| **Heavy Bait** | 20 Fishing Bait + 1 Serpent Trophy | Tuna, Coral Cod |
| **Frosty Bait** | 20 Fishing Bait + 1 Drake Trophy | Northern Salmon |

## Optimal Fishing Locations

Fish species are biome-specific, and using the correct bait in the appropriate biome increases your chances of a successful catch.

### Fish Species by Biome

#### Meadows & Black Forest
- **Perch**: Normal Bait; found at any depth
- **Pike**: Normal Bait; located in semi-deep waters
- **Trollfish**: Mossy Bait; found along the shoreline

#### Swamp
- **Giant Herring**: Sticky Bait; found along the shoreline

#### Mountains (Frost Caves)
- **Tetra**: Cold Bait; found in Frost Cave Lakes at any depth

#### Plains
- **Grouper**: Stingy Bait; found along the shoreline

#### Ocean
- **Tuna**: Heavy Bait; found in deep waters
- **Coral Cod**: Heavy Bait; located in deep waters
- **Pufferfish**: Misty Bait; found in very deep waters

#### Mistlands
- **Anglerfish**: Misty Bait; found along the shoreline

#### Ashlands (Modded)
- **Magmafish**: Hot Bait; found along the shoreline

#### Deep North (Modded)
- **Northern Salmon**: Frosty Bait; found along the shoreline

## Experience Rates and Leveling

### Experience Gain Breakdown
- **Reeling Empty Line**: ~1-2 experience points
- **Reeling in Fish**: ~2-4 experience points (double the empty line rate)
- **Skill Level Effects**: Higher fishing skill reduces stamina consumption and increases efficiency

### Leveling Progression
- **Levels 1-10**: Basic fishing, high stamina consumption
- **Levels 11-25**: Improved efficiency, reduced stamina drain
- **Levels 26-50**: Expert level, minimal stamina consumption
- **Levels 51+**: Master level, maximum efficiency

### Experience Optimization
- **Fully reel hooked fish**: Finish the reel to earn Fishing skill XP. Picking up a beached fish awards no Fishing XP; with EpicMMO it may grant MMO XP only.
- **Active reeling beats waiting**: Reeling an empty line still grants base XP; letting bait sit idle grants none. Keep a steady cast → brief wait → reel → recast cadence.
- **Cast cadence**: If there’s no interest after ~10–15 seconds, reel in and recast to trigger more XP ticks and bites.
- **Use appropriate bait**: Matching bait to biome/species cuts downtime between hooks.
- **Fish where you see fish**: Visible schools and biome hotspots increase hook frequency.
- **Chain sessions**: Longer sessions with Rested buff and stamina foods maximize XP/hour.

## Tips & Tricks

### Casting and Line Control
- **Short casts (10–15m)** conserve stamina and increase landing rates.
- **Tap-reel technique**: When fish run, release to let slack, then re-engage to avoid stamina burn.
- **Hook timing**: Right-click as the bobber dips and the "bloop" plays.
- **Range discipline**: Keep the bobber within ~30m; beyond that, the line snaps.
- **Attraction radius**: Fish can be drawn from far away; be patient after a good cast.

### Spot Selection
- **See the fish**: Prefer visible schools in rivers/shorelines for early skill-ups.
- **Rivers/streams early**, **oceans deep** (Heavy Bait), **Frost Caves** for Tetra (Cold Bait).
- **Build docks/platforms** for safe, repeatable casting angles.
- **Use boats** to reach deep-water spawns and avoid shore aggro.

### Weather and Time
- **Calm daylight** improves visibility and hook timing.
- **Storm quirk**: High waves can strand fish on shore—grab easy pickups.

### Stamina and Loadout
- Eat stamina foods and carry `MeadStamina*` for long sessions.
- Keep your **carry weight light**; stamina drains slower when unburdened.
- Grab the **Rested buff** before heading out.

### XP Optimization
- **Always reel fully**—empty reels grant XP; landed fish grant more.
- **Match bait to biome/species** to reduce time between hooks.
- **Chain-cast rhythm**: cast → wait 10–15s → re-cast if no interest.

### QoL Setups
- Place a **chest** and a **bed/portal** at your dock.
- Keep spare **bait stacks** by biome (e.g., Sticky for Swamp, Heavy for Ocean).

## Troubleshooting

### Fish Escaping
- Low stamina: eat/drink stamina sources; avoid hard reeling while the fish runs.
- Line break: stay within ~30m; step forward while reeling if needed.

### Low Catch Rates
- Wrong bait/biome pairing; relocate to visible schools or correct biome spawns.
- Bad weather/lighting; wait for calmer conditions or use a dock torch.

## Progression Tips by Biome

### Early Game (Meadows/Black Forest)
- **Start with Normal Bait**: Focus on Perch and Pike for early food
- **Practice Mechanics**: Use early fishing to master the system
- **Save Troll Trophies**: Collect for Mossy Bait crafting

### Mid Game (Swamp/Mountains)
- **Craft Specialized Bait**: Use Abomination trophies for Giant Herring
- **Frost Cave Fishing**: Access Tetra with Cold Bait
- **Stockpile Resources**: Build up fish reserves for late game

### Late Game (Plains/Mistlands+)
- **Advanced Bait Types**: Craft Misty Bait for Pufferfish and Anglerfish
- **Ocean Fishing**: Access Tuna and Coral Cod with Heavy Bait
- **Modded Biomes**: Explore Ashlands and Deep North for unique fish
