# Getting Started

    Make the Enchanting Table and unlock the Convert Materials and Enchant as soon as possible by gathering the required materials.
    You will need Novus Runestones and Novus Dust to do Novus Enchanting which will mainly be what you can only do in beginning

Couple things to keep in mind

    Find Haldor in BlackForest as soon as possible in order to do Maps, Bounties and buy materials to help enchant your items.
    Small monsters aka Deer, Wolf etc will not drop enchanted loot
    Chests of any kind will not contain any enchanted loot but will contain magic materials to help with enchanting.
    All small monsters will drop Novus Runestones and or Novus Shards at 10% x1 or 5% for x2
    All creatures will drop Novus Dust at 10% chance.
    Elite creatures aka Trolls etc have a 15% chance of dropping enchanted loot
    Bosses have 100% chance to drop loot
    With the above mentioned, the rarities and amounts are nerfed to be balanced, sometimes you'll get something good and other times it will be trash, utilize the Enchanting Table to sacrifice those items to get materials back.
    Majority of all non boss trophies when sacrificed will give Novus Reagent
    In order to make higher tier magic materials you will need to use Essence which is bought from Haldor and upgrade the materials at the Enchanting Table
    Augmenting the first effect requires Novus Dust and Reagent of that rarity, augmenting any other effects will also require Tokens which are obtained from doing Maps and Bounties from Haldor.

What can be found in Chests in the world.

    Dust, Runestone, Shard, Essence of any rarity
        Rarity is weighted with Novus being most common and Relic being Rare.

Which creatures can drop enchanted loot?

As mentioned only Elite type creatures of each biome will have a 15% to drop loot when killed

    Fox [ Meadows ]
    Troll, GreydwarfBrute [ BlackForest ]
    DraugrElite, Abomination, Wraith, HelWraith [ Swamp ]
    Fenring, Cultist, StoneGolem [ Mountain ]
    Lox, GoblinBrute, Prowler [ Plains ]
    SeekerSoldier, Gjall [ Mistlands ]
    FallenValkyrie, BonemawSerpent,Morgen [ Ashlands ]


# Day One

    On your first day, you'll want to as usual get materials like food, wood, stone and flint to make tools and weapons to help fight off the creatures that attack you. I would first recommend finding a place to make your home base as creatures do hit harder and have more health.
    You will also want to press Tab and click the helmet icon and assign your 5 Free points in to an attribute
    Once you've made a base, craft the Enchanting Table
    How to use the Enchanting Table?
        Sacrifice: This is where you sacrifice old gear or bad gear to get some enchanting materials back, you will also use this tab to turn Trophies dropped from creatures and bosses to get Reagent or Shards.
            Small Creature trophies will give Novus Reagent
            Elite Creatures trophies will give Nexus Reagent
            Boss trophies will give Shards, rarity is based on biome.
        Convert Materials: This is where you will upgrade lower tier materials to higher tier materials, convert shards or other items in to materials and salvage junk like turning Amber in to coins.
            Upgrading anything requires Essence which is bought from Haldor
            Creature Essence and be converted in to Novus Essence or Novus Reagent
        Enchant: This is where you will enchant your items.
            As you kill creatures you will sometimes get random Novus type materials upon death that will help with enchanting, you will only be able to enchant your gear with Novus unless you get lucky with materials inside chests which can contain higher tier materials or until you find Haldor that is located in the BlackForest where you can buy higher tier enchanting materials, do bounties for coins and tokens and treasuremaps for ForestTokens and enchanting materials.
