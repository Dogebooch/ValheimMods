## Overview

The **Epic Loot** mod introduces a comprehensive enchanting system that allows players to enhance their weapons and armor with magical properties. This system provides two primary methods for enchanting equipment, each offering unique advantages and strategic depth.

## Enchanting Methods

### 1. Upgrading with Magic Scrolls

Magic scrolls are consumable items that can be applied directly to weapons and armor to grant them magical effects. This method is perfect for quick enhancements and is accessible early in the game.

#### How to Use Magic Scrolls

1. **Acquire Magic Scrolls**
   - Defeat enemies throughout the world
   - Explore dungeons and chests
   - Complete bounties and special events
   - Purchase from traders (if available)

2. **Apply the Scroll**
   - Open your inventory
   - Right-click on the magic scroll
   - Click on the weapon or armor piece you wish to enhance
   - The enchantment will be applied immediately

#### Magic Scroll Types

- **Weapon Scrolls**: Enhance damage, attack speed, critical chance, and special effects
- **Armor Scrolls**: Provide resistance bonuses, health regeneration, and defensive abilities
- **Utility Scrolls**: Grant unique abilities like teleportation, water walking, or resource detection

### 2. Enchanting via the Enchanting Table

The Enchanting Table is a specialized crafting station that offers more control over enchantments using runes. This method requires more resources but provides greater customization.

#### Crafting the Enchanting Table

**Materials Required:**
- 10 Fine Wood
- 5 Iron
- 2 Obsidian
- 1 Thunderstone

**Crafting Station:** Forge (Level 2)

#### Obtaining Runes

Runes are the essential materials for table enchanting:

- **Boss Trophy Melting**: Convert boss trophies into runes at the Enchanting Table
- **Exploration**: Find runes in chests and special locations
- **Enemy Drops**: Rare drops from powerful enemies
- **Trading**: Exchange with other players or NPCs

#### Using the Enchanting Table

1. **Place the Enchanting Table** at your base
2. **Interact with the table** to open the enchanting interface
3. **Select the item** you wish to enchant
4. **Choose the desired rune** for the enchantment
5. **Initiate the enchantment** process
6. **Collect your enhanced equipment**

## Tips and Tricks

### Strategic Enchantment Planning

- **Diversify Enchantments**: Don't put all your magical eggs in one basket. Spread enchantments across different equipment pieces to maximize effectiveness.
- **Elemental Synergy**: Combine complementary elemental enchantments (e.g., Fire weapon with Fireproof armor for fire-themed builds).
- **Resistance Stacking**: Focus on resistances that match your current biome or boss fight requirements.

### Resource Management

- **Conserve Runes**: Runes are valuable resources. Plan your enchantments carefully and avoid wasteful experimentation.
- **Scroll Priority**: Use magic scrolls for temporary or experimental enchantments, save runes for permanent enhancements.
- **Boss Trophy Strategy**: Don't immediately convert all boss trophies to runes. Some may be needed for other crafting recipes.

### Understanding Effects

- **Read Descriptions**: Carefully read enchantment descriptions to understand their full effects and limitations.
- **Test Combinations**: Experiment with different enchantment combinations to find synergies that complement your playstyle.
- **Consider Durability**: Some enchantments may affect item durability or have maintenance requirements.

### Advanced Techniques

- **Enchantment Stacking**: Some enchantments can be stacked for increased effectiveness (check mod documentation for limits).
- **Temporary vs Permanent**: Use scrolls for situational enchantments and table enchanting for core equipment.
- **Trading Enchanted Items**: Enchanted items can be valuable trade goods with other players.

### Combat Optimization

- **Weapon Specialization**: Enchant weapons based on your preferred combat style (melee, ranged, magic).
- **Defensive Layering**: Combine armor enchantments with food buffs for maximum survivability.
- **Situation Awareness**: Switch enchanted equipment based on the current challenge or biome.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-enchanting**: Don't enchant every piece of equipment immediately. Save resources for better gear.
2. **Ignoring Synergies**: Consider how enchantments work together rather than applying them randomly.
3. **Wasting Runes**: Use scrolls for testing before committing valuable runes to permanent enchantments.
4. **Elemental Mismatch**: Don't use fire enchantments against fire-resistant enemies.

## Troubleshooting

### Enchantment Not Working
- Check if the item is enchantable (some items have restrictions)
- Verify you have the correct materials (scrolls or runes)
- Ensure the Enchanting Table is properly placed and accessible

### Enchantment Conflicts
- Some enchantments may conflict with each other
- Remove conflicting enchantments before applying new ones
- Check mod documentation for known compatibility issues

### Performance Issues
- Too many active enchantments may impact game performance
- Consider removing unnecessary enchantments if experiencing lag
- Update mods to latest versions for optimal performance
